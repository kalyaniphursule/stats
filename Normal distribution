Exercise (Normal Distribution and Z Score for Outlier Removal)

You are given bhp.csv which contains property prices in the city of banglore, India. You need to examine price_per_sqft column and do following,

    Remove outliers using percentile technique first. Use [0.001, 0.999] for lower and upper bound percentiles
    After removing outliers in step 1, you get a new dataframe.
    On step(2) dataframe, use 4 standard deviation to remove outliers
    Plot histogram for new dataframe that is generated after step (3). Also plot bell curve on same histogram
    On step(2) dataframe, use zscore of 4 to remove outliers. This is quite similar to step (3) and you will get exact same result
